<h2>About Boxmeup</h2><br/>
<span>Boxmeup is a web application designed to organize your containers, boxes, and other bulk storage items. Simply create a "container", label it, input items into the container, and Boxmeup takes care of the rest.<br/><br/>

You'll be able to print QR code labels to put onto your containers, which allow you to scan and pull up a list of items in the container on your phone. It also allows you to search all of your containers to find a specific item and Boxmeup tells you where it is!</span>
